### About the site
The site is build completely using bare-bones HTML, CSS & just a dash of JQuery. No frameworks, because I'm nutty like that.

### Running locally
You can run the site locally using one of these methods:

#### Using Python (if installed):
```
# Python 3
python -m http.server

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

#### Using Node.js (if installed):
First, install a server package globally (only need to do once):
```
npm install -g http-server
```

Then run:
```
http-server
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port indicated in the terminal).
