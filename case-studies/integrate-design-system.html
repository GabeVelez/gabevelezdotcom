                    <p></p>

                    <p>In the past, the list view tiles were designed to be venue-focused, instead of focused by the date of the actual event. They also were linked to a venue page which gave information to the page, but then they would have to on that page look for their date again.</p>

                    <p>There also was the development chasm - Iâ€™ve been designing and building Wordpress sites for a while, but only ever kept completely on the front-end. Plugin development was never something I would consider to venture into.</p>

                    <h3 class="block__title">Solution</h3>
                    <p>As the adage goes: Always Be Closing. The decision was made to have these tiles link directly to the sales page instead of the venue page.</p>

                    <p>Also, the design would be more focused on the date instead of the venue, so the user can immediately go buy those tickets for that date they need. We also decided to still show the venue logo strictly for branding purposes.</p>

                    <p class="block__text--small">Original vs New Calendar Tile design.</p>

                    <p>I learned to build a Wordpress plugin and used that hand-coded HTML as a guide. I also used ChatGPT 3.5 to help me write the code for the plugin, and to my surprise it was very helpful. It did hiccup from time to time, so I had to spend time learning how to manage its limits.</p>

                    <p class="block__text--small">No more HTML - a simple form does it all.</p>

                    <p>The plugin basically sets up an admin page section in the Wordpress backend where you can see a new table, pulled from the database, that would show all these events. There team members can add an event using a modal. The event would then be added to the database, where the tabbed calendar area found in the homepage and calendar page can pull data from.</p>

                    <p class="block__text--small">Calendar before & after on the homepage.</p>

                    <p>I also remodeled the venue pages so that calendar data can also be pulled from the database and show only the dates of that venue.</p>

                    <p class="block__text--small">Before and after showing how users can now see the dates related to their prom better.</p>

                    <p>There is also a feature created so a team member can delete an event from the backend. An editing feature is currently in the works, which is scheduled to add in the off-season.</p>
