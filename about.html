                <h1 class="about__intro">I’m a multidisciplinary designer & developer with over <strong>15 years of experience</strong>, concentrating the last decade mostly on delivering a proper User Experience as a product designer to SAAS & e-commerce solutions.</h1>
                <p class="about__text">Currently I serve as the Chief Technology Officer for <a class="company__link" href="https://anom.group" rel="nofollow">A&N Online Marketing</a> working as their entire design & engineering department, responsible for everything from branding to designing, building & maintaining their entire web presence.</p>
                <p class="about__text">In 2017, I served as the sole User Experience Designer at <a class="company__link" href="https://www.integrate.com/press/integrate-acquires-listenloop-to-expand-its-demand-orchestration-platform">ListenLoop</a> , responsible for all aspects of the creative process from interface design to filming & editing marketing videos. I even took on sales calls to better understand the customer more to help them better serve their own customers using our product.</p>
                <p class="about__text">Efforts finally paid off when we became acquired by <a class="company__link" href="https://integrate.com">Integrate</a> in January 2019.
