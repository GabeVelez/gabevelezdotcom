                <h1 class="about__intro">Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary designer & developer with over 20 years of experience. I am currently the CTO for <a href="https://anom.group">A&N Online Marketing</a>. There I'm working as their entire design & engineering department. I'm based in Queens, New York.</h1>
                <p class="about__text">In 2017, I served as the sole User Experience Designer at <a href="https://www.integrate.com/press/integrate-acquires-listenloop-to-expand-its-demand-orchestration-platform">ListenLoop</a>. In that role, I got involved in all aspects of the creative process. I worked on interface design, filming & editing marketing videos, and I even took on sales calls! I did all this to better understand the customer more to help them better serve their own customers. Efforts paid off when we were acquired by <a href="https://www.integrate.com/">Integrate</a> in January 2019. There I spent 2 1/2 years continuing in my journey as the UX Designer in their ABM department. I also spent my time there working on Product Improvement of their Marketplace. I also contributed towards developing their Design System.</p>
                <p class="about__text">When I'm not designing or writing code, I'm doing what I can to take advantage of Queens New York's diverse cuisine. I'm also a fan of cinema, and watch way too much anime.</p>
