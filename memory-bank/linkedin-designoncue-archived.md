## Notes for Future Use

**If repositioning for freelance work in 2026:**
- Consider removing or updating the "1994" start date to avoid age discrimination
- Update description to emphasize modern tech stack (React, Next.js, Figma)
- Consider changing to "Design & Development Consultancy" instead of "freelance portfolio"
- Could update to focus on B2B SaaS clients and analytics dashboard work if pivoting back to freelance
- May want to align with current positioning (analytics dashboards, Fortune 500 platforms)

**Alternative approach for 2026:**
- Create new consultancy with current positioning rather than reviving 31-year-old entity
- Use TokTix as proof of 0-1 capability for freelance clients
- Position as "Product Design & Engineering Consultant" rather than generic "Creative Lead"

## Context

This was removed from LinkedIn during December 2024 job search positioning update to:
1. Remove age discrimination indicators (31+ years in business)
2. Maintain consistency with resume (which excludes DesignOnCue)
3. Focus LinkedIn profile on analytics dashboards, Fortune 500 experience, and 200K+ user scale
4. Make room for TokTix as current work

If job market requires pivot to freelance in 2026, this text can be adapted and re-added with updated positioning.
