• **Conversion focus:** Increased conversion rates 69% YoY through data-driven design iterations, A/B testing, and analytics-informed improvements

• **Full-stack ownership:** I design in Figma and ship in React, Next.js, React Native, and Firebase—no handoff gaps or translation loss between design and development

• **Enterprise background:** As Product Designer at Integrate (post-ListenLoop acquisition), I designed for Fortune 500 clients including Microsoft and Oracle, leading design system initiatives and WCAG 2.0 accessibility compliance

## Company-Specific Customization Examples

### For Companies Emphasizing Design Systems

**Add this paragraph:**

"I'm particularly drawn to [Company]'s focus on [design system/component library/design ops]. At Integrate, I led a design system audit that unified 3 post-acquisition companies, reduced colors by 55%, and ensured full WCAG 2.0 compliance. I understand both the design principles and the React implementation required to build scalable component libraries."

### For Companies Emphasizing Conversion/Growth

**Add this paragraph:**

"I noticed [Company]'s emphasis on [conversion optimization/growth/metrics]. This aligns perfectly with my approach—I've driven 69% YoY conversion growth and 900+ annual conversions through systematic UX improvements, A/B testing, and analytics-driven design decisions. I believe great design must be validated by measurable business impact."

### For Companies Building 0-1 Products

**Add this paragraph:**

"I'm excited about [Company]'s work on [new product/initiative]. I specialize in 0-1 product ownership—most recently building TokTix from concept to deployment (React Native, Firebase, Stripe Connect). I thrive in ambiguous environments where I can own the full product experience from research through engineering."

### For Companies With Strong Engineering Culture

**Add this paragraph:**

"I appreciate [Company]'s engineering-driven culture. As a designer who writes production code, I can contribute to technical discussions, review PRs, and ship features independently. My recent work includes React Native mobile apps, Next.js web platforms, Firebase backend architecture, and Stripe Connect payment integrations."

### For Enterprise/B2B Companies

**Add this paragraph:**

"My experience at Integrate designing for Fortune 500 clients (Microsoft, Oracle, SAP) has given me deep understanding of enterprise UX patterns, complex permission systems, and multi-stakeholder design processes. I know how to balance user needs with business constraints in B2B environments."

### For Consumer/Mobile-First Companies

**Add this paragraph:**

"I'm drawn to [Company]'s consumer focus and mobile-first approach. I've built production React Native apps (TokTix ticketing platform), designed for 200K+ annual users across mobile and web, and understand the unique constraints of mobile UX design. I can design and ship features without handoff delays."

## DO NOT Include (Age-Aware Tactics)

❌ **Don't mention:** Years of experience beyond 10+ (avoid "15 years" or specific graduation dates)
❌ **Don't mention:** "Extensive experience," "seasoned," "veteran" (sounds old)
❌ **Don't mention:** Management experience unless role explicitly requires it
❌ **Don't mention:** Legacy technologies (jQuery, PHP, older frameworks)
❌ **Don't mention:** Your age or any age-related context
❌ **Don't mention:** "Looking to transition from leadership to IC" (signals overqualification)

---

## DO Include (Modern IC Positioning)

✅ **Do mention:** Current tech stack (React, Next.js, React Native, Firebase)
✅ **Do mention:** AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor) to appear current
✅ **Do mention:** Recent work (TokTix 2024) to show you're actively building
✅ **Do mention:** Quantified outcomes (69% YoY growth, 200K+ users)
✅ **Do mention:** "Individual contributor" or "IC" explicitly
✅ **Do mention:** "Hands-on with code" to signal you're not a manager stepping down

---

## Length Guidelines

**Keep it to 3-4 short paragraphs maximum:**
1. Opening: Who you are + key metric
2. Why you're a fit: 2-3 bullet points matching job description
3. What you're looking for: IC role emphasis
4. Closing: Portfolio link + availability

**Total length:** 250-350 words (recruiters spend ~20 seconds scanning)

---

## Tone Guidelines

- **Professional but approachable**: Not corporate jargon-heavy
- **Confident but not arrogant**: Let metrics speak for themselves
- **Specific, not generic**: Always tie to job description requirements
- **Action-oriented**: Use strong verbs (scaled, drove, built, shipped)

---

## Application Strategy (From Strategy Document)

### When to Send Cover Letter

**Always send for:**
- Direct applications on company career sites
- Roles you're genuinely excited about
- Smaller companies (<500 employees)
- When the job description specifically requests one

**Skip for:**
- LinkedIn Easy Apply (usually ignored)
- Very large companies with heavy ATS filtering (resume is what matters)
- Roles where you're borderline unqualified (save time)

### Customization Effort

**High effort (30-45 min):**
- Dream companies
- Perfect role match
- Personal referral applications

**Medium effort (15-20 min):**
- Strong fit roles
- Companies you're interested in
- Most applications

**Low effort (5-10 min):**
- Volume applications
- Stretch roles
- Third-tier choices

**Use this template to reduce medium-effort applications to 15 minutes by swapping in relevant bullet points and company-specific paragraph.**

## Key Success Metrics

After implementing this template across 20-30 applications with updated resume/LinkedIn:

**Track:**
- Application → Phone Screen conversion rate (target: 5-10%)
- Time spent per application (target: <20 min for medium effort)
- Which bullet points/paragraphs get mentioned in recruiter calls

**Adjust if:**
- <3% phone screen rate after 30 applications → positioning still wrong
- >45 min per application → template isn't reducing workload enough
- Recruiters asking about management experience → IC signal not strong enough
