# Portfolio Positioning Strategy - December 2025
**Objective:** Fix 60+ application rejections by repositioning from "small company WordPress designer" to "senior IC managing 200K+ users at enterprise scale"

---

## THE PROBLEM (Root Cause Analysis)

### What Was Happening:
- **60+ applications, 0 interviews**
- Applying for $140K+ Senior/Lead/Staff Product Designer roles
- Getting filtered out at ATS/HR screening stage (never reaching hiring managers)

### Why It Was Happening:
1. **Hidden scale:** Managing 200K+ users across 7 properties, but positioned as "small company CTO"
2. **Title confusion:** "CTO at A&N Online Marketing" reads as "executive at unknown company"
3. **No scale signals:** Resume/LinkedIn didn't communicate 200K users, 69% conversion growth, 900+ conversions
4. **Overqualification perception:** At 49, CTO title makes companies think "too senior, will expect VP track"
5. **WordPress perception:** Even though you do React/Next.js/React Native, current role emphasis on WordPress

### Analytics Proof:
- **Portfolio traffic:** 12 real visitors in 30 days (after filtering test accounts)
- **Average time on site:** 40 seconds
- **Conversion to case studies:** 0%
- **Conclusion:** Even when they view portfolio, messaging isn't converting to interest

---

## THE SOLUTION (Age-Aware IC Positioning)

### Core Strategy:
Position as **senior individual contributor (IC) with enterprise scale experience** who still ships code and wants to keep building (not manage).

### Key Messaging Shifts:

| BEFORE (What Hurt You) | AFTER (What Works) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| "CTO at A&N Online Marketing" | "Senior Product Designer & Engineering Lead managing 200K+ users" |
| "Multi-disciplined designer and developer" | "0-1 product ownership from design to deployment" |
| Scale hidden | "200K+ annual users, 69% YoY conversion growth" |
| Generic positioning | "Previously: Integrate (Acquired ListenLoop)" |
| No IC signal | "Seeking IC roles" explicit in headline |

---

## CONFIRMED A&N SCALE METRICS

### Portfolio Overview:
- **7 active event platform properties**
- **214,200+ annual active users** (YTD 2025)
- **Geographic reach:** US, Europe, Asia-Pacific (7+ countries)
- **Tracked conversions:** 900+ purchases annually
- **Year-over-year growth:** 69% conversion improvement, 15% user engagement increase

### Individual Properties:
1. **NYCNewYears.com** - 110K users (flagship property)
2. **AfterPromCentral** - 27K users (prom season events)
3. **NYC Halloween Parties** - 51K users (Halloween events)
4. **NY July 4th** - 13K users (Independence Day events)
5. **Super Bowl Parties** - 8.3K users (sporting events)
6. **NYC Derby Watch Parties** - 3.2K users (Kentucky Derby)
7. **NYC Cigar Parties** - 1.8K users (niche social events)

**This is legitimate mid-tier enterprise scale** - comparable to Series B/C startups.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### ✅ PHASE 1: LinkedIn Profile (DO THIS FIRST)

#### 1. Update LinkedIn Headline
**Current:**
> Gabe Velez - Lead Product Designer & Product Developer at A&N Online Marketing

**NEW:**
```
Senior Product Designer & Engineer | 200K+ Users | Full-Stack | Previously: Integrate (Acquired ListenLoop) | Seeking IC Roles
```

**Why this works:**
- Leads with "Senior" not "CTO" (signals IC focus)
- "200K+ Users" = immediate scale proof
- "Full-Stack" = differentiator without sounding exec-level
- "Seeking IC Roles" = explicit signal you're not looking to manage teams

---

#### 2. Rewrite LinkedIn Summary

**NEW SUMMARY:**
```
Senior product designer and full-stack developer with 10+ years shipping platforms that drive measurable business outcomes.

Currently managing product design and engineering for A&N Online Marketing's event platform portfolio (7 properties, 200K+ annual users, 69% YoY conversion growth). I own the complete product lifecycle: user research, UX/UI design, front-end development (React, Next.js, WordPress), deployment, and analytics optimization.

Previously Product Designer at Integrate following their acquisition of ListenLoop, where I designed enterprise B2B experiences for Fortune 500 clients, led design system initiatives, and delivered WCAG 2.0 accessibility compliance across acquired products.

**What I bring to teams:**
- 0-1 product ownership: Design → code → deployed product
- Conversion optimization: 15-69% YoY growth across multiple properties
- Design systems at scale: Enterprise B2B and high-traffic consumer platforms
- Modern stack fluency: React, Next.js, React Native, Firebase, WordPress
- AI-assisted development: Rapid prototyping and iteration using ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor

**What I'm looking for:**
Senior Product Designer, Staff Designer, or Design Engineer roles at companies building products that matter. I thrive as an individual contributor who can bridge design and engineering, move fast, and drive measurable impact.

Open to opportunities starting January 2026. Let's connect: [Add Calendly link once set up]
```

**Strategic elements:**
- "Individual contributor" explicitly stated
- No mention of "leadership" or "management"
- Emphasis on maker/builder identity
- Modern AI tools prominent (signals you're current, not legacy)
- Availability date creates urgency

---

#### 3. Update LinkedIn Experience Section

**Why this framing works:**

```

```

**Key changes:**
- Added "Seeking... individual contributor" → explicit IC signal
- Lead with outcomes (69%, 200K users) not just years
- "Contribute as IC" → you're not looking to climb ladder to VP

---

#### A&N Online Marketing Experience:
```
A&N Online Marketing / Senior Product Designer & Engineering Lead
APR 2022 - PRESENT (REMOTE)

• Scaled portfolio of 7 event platforms to 200K+ annual active users across US, Europe,
  and Asia-Pacific markets through systematic UX optimization and performance improvements

• Reduced site launch time 30% through modular design systems and streamlined deployment processes
```

**Strategic framing:**

- Leads with user scale (200K+)
- Emphasizes hands-on work ("own complete lifecycle," "front-end development")
- Business outcomes prominent (69% conversion, 900 conversions)
- No mention of "team management"

---

#### CRITICAL: Update Google Careers Profile
- Change job title from "Founder" to "Senior Product Designer & Engineering Lead"
- Update work experience bullets to match resume above
- **VERIFY TikTok vs TokTix error is fixed** (you said you fixed it, but double-check)

---

### ✅ PHASE 3: Portfolio Homepage Rewrite

#### NEW HERO SECTION:

Replace current hero copy:
```html
<!-- CURRENT (Generic) -->
<h1>Hi, my name is GABE.</h1>
<p>I'm a multi-disciplined designer and developer with over 10 years of experience.</p>
<p>Currently I serve as the Lead Product Designer & Product Developer for A&N ONLINE MARKETING...</p>
```

**WITH NEW (Specific, Scale-Focused):**

```html
<h1>Hi, I'm Gabe.</h1>
<h2>Senior Product Designer who ships code.</h2>

<p>10+ years building products from design to deployment. Currently managing 7 event platforms serving <strong>200K+ annual users</strong> with <strong>69% YoY conversion growth</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Previously:</strong> Product Designer at <a href="https://integrate.com">Integrate</a> following their acquisition of ListenLoop. Designed enterprise B2B experiences for Fortune 500 clients and led design system initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>What I do:</strong> 0-1 product ownership, conversion optimization, design systems, and full-stack development (React, Next.js, React Native, Firebase).</p>

<p><strong>Seeking:</strong> Senior Product Designer or Design Engineer roles where I can contribute as an IC driving measurable impact.</p>

<p><strong>Available:</strong> January 2026 | <a href="[YOUR CALENDLY LINK]">Let's talk</a></p>
```

**Why this works:**
- Immediate scale proof in first paragraph (200K users, 69% growth)
- Acquisition credential in second paragraph
- Clear about what you're seeking (IC roles)
- Availability + CTA creates urgency
- Still includes current location (can be added if needed)

---

#### PROJECT CARD ORDER:
Reorder Featured Projects section to lead with strongest ownership stories:

1. **TokTix Event Ticketing App** (MOVE TO #1)
   - Update description: "Two-sided marketplace built entirely solo using React Native, Expo, Firebase, Next.js, and Stripe Connect. Complete 0-1 product ownership from design to deployment."
   - Add badge: "SOLO FOUNDER" + "FULL-STACK"

2. **Integrate Design System Audit** (KEEP AS #2)
   - Update description: "Unified design language across 3 acquired companies for Fortune 500 enterprise clients. Reduced colors 55% and ensured WCAG 2.0 accessibility compliance."
   - Add context: "Enterprise B2B SaaS | Post-Acquisition"

3. **NYCNewYears.com Site Overhaul** (MOVE TO #3)
   - Update description: "Redesigned and optimized NYC's largest New Year's Eve event platform. Slashed 48% of code while serving 110K+ annual users and thousands of tourists."
   - Add metrics: "110K+ Users | 48% Code Reduction"

**Why this order:**
- TokTix first = shows recent (2024), modern stack, full ownership
- Integrate second = enterprise credibility, acquisition pedigree
- NYCNewYears third = scale + conversion optimization proof

---

### ✅ PHASE 5: Application Strategy

#### Cover Letter Template (Age-Aware IC Positioning):

```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

I'm reaching out about the [Job Title] role at [Company]. After [specific experience at the company/with their product], I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute as a senior IC focused on [key challenge from job description].

I bring 10+ years of 0-1 product ownership, currently managing 7 event platforms serving 200K+ annual users with 69% YoY conversion growth. My background includes:

• Full-stack product development: Design, React/Next.js development, deployment, analytics
• Measurable outcomes: 69% conversion improvement, 200K+ users scaled, 900+ annual conversions
• Enterprise experience: Design systems and B2B products for Fortune 500 clients at Integrate (post-acquisition of ListenLoop)
• Modern stack: React Native, Next.js, Firebase, AI-assisted development

What differentiates me: I ship code, not just specs. I've built mobile apps solo (TokTix), scaled multi-property platforms, and contributed production HTML/CSS/JS at enterprise companies. I thrive as an IC who bridges design and engineering to drive measurable impact.

I'm seeking an IC role where I can contribute immediately without needing management responsibilities. Available January 2026.

Portfolio: gabevelez.com
Let's talk: [calendly link]

Best,
Gabe Velez
```

**Key elements:**
- Leads with scale (200K users) not years of experience
- Emphasizes IC positioning ("contribute as IC," "without management responsibilities")
- Shows you're hands-on ("I ship code, not just specs")
- Modern stack signals you're current
- Availability + urgency

---

#### When Applying Through ATS:

**For "Current Job Title" field:**
- ✅ Use: "Senior Product Designer & Engineering Lead"
- ❌ Avoid: "CTO" or "Chief Technology Officer"

**For "Reason for Leaving" field:**
- ✅ Use: "Seeking full-time senior IC role at larger company"
- ❌ Avoid: "Company too small" or "Underpaid"

**For "Desired Salary" field:**
- Enter: $140,000 - $160,000 (or leave blank if optional)
- Never go below $140K given your scale experience

---

### ✅ PHASE 6: GitHub Pages + Static Site Fixes

#### Ensure Portfolio is Optimal:
1. **Remove A/B test** (currently diluting data with 62% untracked)
   - Set one variant to 100% or remove test entirely
2. **Add structured data** for better ATS parsing (you already have Person schema, ensure it's complete)
3. **Update meta descriptions** to include scale + keywords:
   ```html
   <meta name="description" content="Gabriel Velez - Senior Product Designer managing 200K+ users. 0-1 product ownership, conversion optimization, design systems. Previously Integrate (acquired ListenLoop).">
   ```

---

## AGE-AWARE POSITIONING STRATEGY

### The Challenge (At Age 49):
Companies see "CTO" title and assume:
- ❌ You want executive comp ($250K+)
- ❌ You'll expect to manage people
- ❌ You're "overqualified" and will leave quickly
- ❌ You're not hands-on with code anymore

### The Solution:
Your positioning must scream:
- ✅ "I'm a maker, not a manager"
- ✅ "I write code, I don't just direct it"
- ✅ "I'm seeking IC stability, not C-suite politics"
- ✅ "I'm current with 2024 tools" (AI, modern stack)

### Resume Tactics to Look "Current" Not "Legacy":

**EMPHASIZE:**
- ✅ AI Tools section (ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline)
- ✅ Modern frameworks (React Native, Next.js, Expo, Firebase)
- ✅ Recent projects (TokTix Sep 2024, A&N 2022-present)
- ✅ Current metrics (2024-2025 growth numbers)
- ✅ "Available January 2026" (shows you're active, not desperate)

**REMOVE/MINIMIZE:**
- ❌ Graduation year (if listed anywhere)
- ❌ Pre-2015 work experience (anything before Gamechat)
- ❌ "10+ years" overemphasis (dates you)
- ❌ Legacy tech mentions (Flash, Dreamweaver, jQuery, etc.)
- ❌ Age-revealing phrases ("seasoned," "veteran," "established")

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### How to Measure if This Is Working:

**Week 1-2 (LinkedIn Changes):**
- Profile views increase (baseline: track current views)
- InMail/recruiter outreach increases
- Connection requests from recruiters

**Week 3-4 (Resume in Applications):**
- Phone screens increase (target: 10-15% of applications)
- Fewer instant rejections (you were getting 100% rejection)
- Questions about "are you open to IC roles?" (means positioning is working)

**Week 5-8 (Full Funnel):**
- First-round interviews: Target 5-10 from 50 applications
- Portfolio feedback: Ask interviewers "what stood out?"
- Salary discussions: If they're discussing $140K+, positioning worked

### Red Flags That Positioning Failed:
- ❌ Still getting "overqualified" feedback
- ❌ "We're looking for someone more senior" (means you're reading junior despite 200K users)
- ❌ "Are you sure you don't want to manage a team?" (IC positioning unclear)
- ❌ Instant rejections continue (ATS still filtering you out)

---

---

## EMERGENCY CONTACTS & BACKUP PLAN

### If This Doesn't Work After 30 Days:

**Plan B Options:**
1. **Fractional CTO positioning** - Pivot to "Fractional CTO for hire" and position A&N as consulting client
2. **Design Engineer focus** - Apply exclusively to Design Engineer roles (less competition, values code)
3. **Direct outreach** - Skip ATS, find hiring managers on LinkedIn, send cold DMs with portfolio
4. **Freelance bridge** - Take 1-2 Upwork/Toptal contracts to bridge to Jan 2026, then pivot
5. **Network referrals** - Leverage your brother at Amazon for warm intros to other designers

### Your Network Assets:
- Brother at Amazon (already tried, but can ask for warm intros to other designers)
- ListenLoop → Integrate connections (reach out to former colleagues)
- Testimonials on portfolio (ask them to make LinkedIn intros)
- Nacer Hamai (COO, A&N) - can he make intros to his network?
- Sandeep Arneja (CTO, ListenLoop) - reconnect, ask for referrals

---

## FINAL REMINDERS

### The Core Message (Memorize This):
> "I'm a senior IC managing 200K+ users who still ships code. Previously designed for Fortune 500 clients at Integrate post-acquisition. Seeking senior product design or design engineer roles where I can drive measurable impact without managing teams. Available January 2026."

### What Makes You Different:
1. **Scale + IC:** 200K users managed, but you write the code yourself
2. **Design + Code:** Ship production React/Next.js, not just Figma files
3. **Proven outcomes:** 69% conversion growth, 900+ conversions tracked
4. **Acquisition pedigree:** Integrate/ListenLoop validates enterprise capability
5. **Current stack:** AI-assisted development, React Native, modern tooling

### The One Thing to Remember:
**You have the credentials for $140K+ roles. You were just hiding them.**

Your 60 rejections weren't because you're not qualified - they were because your positioning made you look:
- Too small (A&N unknown company)
- Too vague (multi-disciplined = no specialty)
- Too senior (CTO = management track)
- Too unclear (no scale metrics visible)

**Now your positioning clearly states:**
- ✅ Enterprise scale (200K+ users)
- ✅ Specific value (0-1 ownership, conversion optimization)
- ✅ IC focus (seeking roles without management)
- ✅ Quantified proof (69% growth, 900 conversions)

---

## QUESTIONS? ISSUES?

If something isn't clear or you need help implementing any section:

1. **LinkedIn changes:** Copy/paste exactly as written, customize company names/links as needed
2. **Resume updates:** Use the A&N bullet points verbatim, they're optimized for ATS keywords
3. **Portfolio code changes:** I can help implement the HTML changes if needed
4. **Calendly setup:** Free account works fine, paid is optional for branding
5. **Application strategy:** Use the cover letter template, adjust for each company

**The most important thing: Execute LinkedIn + Resume updates in the next 48 hours.** Those two changes will have immediate impact on your next applications.
