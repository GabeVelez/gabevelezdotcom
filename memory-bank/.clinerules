# Gabe Velez Portfolio Website - Project Rules & Patterns

## Coding Standards

### HTML Patterns
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`, etc.)
- Include appropriate ARIA attributes and roles for accessibility
- Maintain proper indentation (4 spaces)
- Use lowercase for all HTML element names and attributes
- Include descriptive alt text for all images
- Use the `<picture>` element with multiple sources for responsive images
- Add loading="lazy" for images below the fold
- Add `decoding="async"` to images for performance

### CSS Patterns
- Use CSS custom properties for colors defined in :root
- Follow BEM naming convention (Block__Element--Modifier)
- Mobile-first approach with min-width media queries
- Breakpoints at 600px (tablet) and 1060px (desktop)
- Avoid !important declarations
- Group related properties together
- Use relative units (rem, em, %) over absolute units (px) where appropriate
- For dynamic backgrounds, use transparent backgrounds on block elements
- Use CSS transitions for smooth color changes (e.g., transition: background-color 1.2s ease)

### JavaScript Patterns
- Use jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX
- Keep JavaScript minimal and focused on specific interactions
- Use the jQuery document ready pattern: `$(function() { ... })`
- Component loading handled through layout.js
- Scroll-based interactions in scroll.js
- Dynamic backgrounds for case studies controlled via dynamic-background.js

## Project Preferences

### Design System
- Color palette defined in CSS variables:
  - `--gabe-black: #1B2021`
  - `--gabe-black-alpha: rgb(27 32 33 / 85%)`
  - `--gabe-white: #FFFFFF`
  - `--gabe-gray: #364042`
  - `--gabe-red: #800020`
  - `--gabe-darkred: #240000`
  - `--gabe-teal: #235965`
  - `--gabe-gold: #e9c35c`
- Typography: Poppins font family from Adobe Fonts
- Card-based layout for portfolio items
- Block-based content sections for case studies
- Consistent spacing patterns throughout

### File Organization
- Page templates at root level
- CSS in /css directory
- Layout components in /layout directory
- Case studies in /case-studies directory
- Side projects in /side-projects directory
- Images in /img directory, with naming conventions:
  - Responsive variants: image.webp, image@2x.webp
  - Device-specific variants: image-desktop.webp, image-tablet.webp, image-mobile.webp
  - Side project images: sideCard_[ProjectName].webp, sideCard_[ProjectName]@2x.webp

### Content Structure Evolution
The portfolio has evolved beyond traditional case studies to include:

**Homepage Structure**:
1. Hero section (professional introduction)
2. Featured Projects (traditional client case studies)
3. Side Projects (entrepreneurial work)
4. Testimonials (social proof)

**Case Study Types**:
- **Traditional Case Studies**: Client work demonstrating professional expertise
- **Side Projects**: Independent work showcasing entrepreneurial capability and technical leadership

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Adding a New Traditional Case Study
1. Create HTML file in /case-studies directory
2. Follow existing case study template structure
3. Prepare images in multiple sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) and formats
4. Add card to index.html in the cases__container section
5. For work-in-progress studies, add `disabled` class to card and include `card__banner` element
6. Include `casestudy` class in the body tag to enable dynamic background functionality
7. Add a summary section after the role description to provide a concise overview
8. Ensure each section has the appropriate block color class (block__teal, block__gray, etc.)

### Adding a New Side Project
1. Create HTML file in /side-projects directory
2. Follow case study template but emphasize:
   - Technical architecture and development approach
   - Solo development challenges and solutions
   - Business understanding and market context
   - Complete product development lifecycle
3. Add card to index.html in the side-projects__container section
4. Use side project image naming convention (sideCard_[Name].webp)
5. Include `casestudy` class in body tag for dynamic backgrounds
6. Emphasize entrepreneurial and technical leadership aspects

### Adding a New Testimonial
1. Update index.html testimonials section
2. Follow testimonial-card structure:
   ```html
   <div class="testimonial-card">
       <blockquote class="testimonial-card__quote">[quote]</blockquote>
       <div class="testimonial-card__author">
           <img class="testimonial-card__avatar" src="img/[image].jpeg" alt="[Name]">
           <div class="testimonial-card__details">
               <div class="testimonial-card__name">[Name]</div>
               <div class="testimonial-card__title">[Professional Title]</div>
           </div>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```
3. Include professional headshot in img/ directory
4. Ensure attribution includes full name and professional title

### Adding a New Page
1. Create HTML file at appropriate location
2. Include standard head section (meta tags, title, links to CSS and JS)
3. Use proper body class for styling (e.g., `class="page"` or `class="home"`)
4. Include empty header and footer elements to be populated by layout.js
5. Add page to navigation in both nav.html and nav_index.html

### Updating Site Content
1. Edit relevant HTML files directly
2. For global components like navigation or footer, update files in /layout directory
3. Be aware that jQuery loads these components, so changes will affect all pages

### CSS Modifications
1. All styles are in css/style.css
2. Mobile styles are the default (no media query needed)
3. Tablet styles use `@media (min-width: 600px)`
4. Desktop styles use `@media (min-width: 1060px)`
5. Follow existing naming conventions when adding new classes
