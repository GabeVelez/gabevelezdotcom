## 📊 Tracking & Success Metrics

### Week 1-2: Profile Updates

**LinkedIn:**
- [ ] Profile views per week (target: 2-3x increase from baseline)
- [ ] Recruiter InMail messages (target: 1-2 per week)
- [ ] Connection requests from recruiters

**Portfolio:**
- [ ] PostHog session recordings (watch first 5 recruiter sessions)
- [ ] Average time on page (target: >60 seconds, up from 40)
- [ ] Case study click-through rate (target: >0%, currently 0%)

---

### Week 3-6: Application Performance

**Application → Phone Screen Funnel:**
- [ ] Applications submitted: [Target: 20-30]
- [ ] Phone screens scheduled: [Target: 1-3 = 5-10% conversion]
- [ ] On-site interviews: [Target: 30-50% of phone screens]
- [ ] Offers: [Target: 1+ from 20-30 applications]

**If after 30 applications you have:**
- **<3% phone screen rate** → Positioning still wrong, reassess
- **3-7% phone screen rate** → On track, keep going
- **7-10% phone screen rate** → Good, positioning working
- **>10% phone screen rate** → Excellent, you've fixed the problem

**Phone Screen → On-site conversion:**
- **<20%** → Interview performance needs work (practice more)
- **20-40%** → Normal range
- **>40%** → Very strong, positioning + interview skills both working

---

### Month 2-3: Offer Stage

**Target Timeline:**
- Month 1: Fix positioning, apply to 20-30 roles
- Month 2: 1-3 phone screens, 1-2 on-sites
- Month 3: 1+ offers, negotiation, acceptance

**By January 2026:** Employed or final round interviews

---

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

### If you're NOT getting phone screens after fixing positioning:

**Possible issues:**
1. **Still being filtered by ATS**
   - Solution: Add more keywords from job descriptions to resume
   - Solution: Apply directly on company sites (not LinkedIn Easy Apply)

2. **Resume format issues**
   - Solution: Use plain text resume, no fancy formatting
   - Solution: Ensure resume is ATS-parseable (test with Jobscan)

3. **LinkedIn/Resume mismatch**
   - Solution: Ensure LinkedIn and resume tell same story (recruiters check both)

4. **Overqualification still showing through**
   - Solution: Remove more management/leadership language
   - Solution: Emphasize "IC" more explicitly in headline

5. **Wrong roles targeted**
   - Solution: Only apply to "Senior Product Designer" or "Staff Product Designer" (not Principal/Director)
   - Solution: Avoid "Lead" titles (implies management)

---

### If you're getting phone screens but not progressing:

**Possible issues:**
1. **Interview skills rusty** (you haven't interviewed in years)
   - Solution: Practice with Exponent, Pramp, or friend mock interviews
   - Solution: Record yourself answering common questions

2. **Portfolio case studies need work**
   - Solution: Expand TokTix case study (most impressive work)
   - Solution: Add more business metrics to existing case studies

3. **Coming across as overqualified in conversations**
   - Solution: Emphasize "I want to stay hands-on with code"
   - Solution: Downplay leadership experience

4. **Age discrimination** (interviewers see you're 49)
   - Solution: Can't fully control this, but emphasize modern tools (AI, React Native)
   - Solution: Show energy and enthusiasm (not "I'm winding down my career")

## 💡 Key Insights from This Process

1. **Scale was hidden:** You were managing 214K+ users but positioning as "Lead Designer at small company" - that's why ATS filtered you out

2. **Title confusion:** "CTO" at 3-person company + "Lead Product Designer" sounded inconsistent. "Senior Product Designer & Engineering Lead" is clearer IC positioning

3. **Age-aware tactics matter:** At 49, emphasizing IC role, modern tech stack, and recent work (TokTix 2024) counters overqualification perception

4. **Metrics are currency:** "69% YoY conversion growth" and "200K+ users" are more valuable than "10+ years experience" or "multi-disciplined"

5. **Portfolio engagement was symptom, not cause:** 0% case study clicks + 60 rejections meant the problem was upstream (positioning) not downstream (portfolio design)
