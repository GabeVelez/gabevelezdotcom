# Attentive Cover Letter - Senior Product Designer

**Subject Line:** Application for Senior Product Designer - Gabe Velez

---

Dear Attentive Design Team,

I'm applying for the Senior Product Designer role on the Creatives team. With 10+ years as a product designer who ships code, I've designed analytics dashboards for Fortune 500 marketing platforms and scaled event products to 200K+ users with 69% YoY conversion growth.

**Why I'm a fit for Attentive:**

• **Marketing tools for Fortune 500 clients:** At Integrate (post-ListenLoop acquisition), I designed ABM web analytics dashboards that helped marketing teams track engagement, score accounts, and optimize conversion funnels. I understand how to build tools that turn data into actionable insights for marketers.

• **Conversion and growth focus:** Increased conversion rates 69% YoY through systematic UX optimization and A/B testing at NYCNewYears.com. I've designed on-site experiences that capture high-intent users and turn them into customers. I know how to measure impact and iterate based on real user behavior.

• **Data-driven product design:** At ListenLoop, I designed analytics dashboards showing visitor tracking data, engagement scoring, behavior analytics, and multi-touch attribution. I think in terms of metrics, funnels, and optimization loops, which aligns with how the Creatives team approaches growth.

• **Full-stack ownership:** I design in Figma and ship in React, Next.js, and Firebase. No handoff gaps between design and engineering. I can prototype interactions, collaborate with PMs on technical constraints, and contribute to design system decisions.

• **AI-powered experiences:** Currently building AI features for TokTix (OCR flyer extraction, content generation). I'm excited about Attentive's work on AI-driven personalization and tailored creative experiences.

**What I bring to the team:**

I'll be honest, my background leans toward analytics tools rather than creative authoring tools. But here's what transfers directly: I understand how marketers think, what metrics they care about, and how to design interfaces that help them move fast without breaking things. Whether it's an analytics dashboard or a sign-up unit builder, the job is the same: turn complexity into clarity and make the tool disappear so the marketer can focus on their strategy.

I've designed systems at scale (200K+ users), worked on B2B platforms serving Fortune 500 teams, and shipped 0-1 products from concept to deployment. I know how to balance craft with business outcomes and experimentation with consistency.

**What I'm looking for:**

I'm seeking a senior IC role where I can stay hands-on with design and code while driving measurable product impact. I'm not pursuing management positions. I want to ship features, mentor designers through critique, and solve big problems at scale.

I'm drawn to Attentive's focus on real-time behavioral insights and personalized experiences. The idea of designing tools that help brands capture billions of interactions and turn them into revenue is exactly the kind of high-impact work I want to focus on.

My work is available at gabevelez.com with case studies showing design systems (Integrate), conversion optimization (NYCNewYears), and 0-1 product development (TokTix). Currently finishing a case study on the Integrate ABM analytics dashboard work, which demonstrates designing data visualization tools for marketing teams at Fortune 500 companies.

I'm available starting January 2026 and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my analytics and conversion optimization background could contribute to the Creatives team.
