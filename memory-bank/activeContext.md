# Active Context - Gabe Velez Portfolio Website

## Current Focus

The Gabe Velez portfolio website is currently in a functional state with core features implemented. The current focus appears to be:

1. **Completing Additional Case Studies** - Two case studies are currently active, while two others are marked as "Under Construction" in the codebase (commented out in the HTML).
2. **Resume Updates** - The site includes a 2025 version of the resume (GabeVelezResume2025.pdf).
3. **Maintaining Current Information** - The website reflects Gabe's current role as CTO at A&N Online Marketing.

## Recent Changes

Based on code analysis, recent changes include:

1. **Case Study Implementation** - The AfterPromCentral Events Calendar case study was recently completed (dated January-March 2024).
2. **jQuery Update** - The site uses jQuery 3.7.1, which is a recent version, suggesting an update to the library.
3. **Resume Update** - The presence of a 2025-dated resume indicates recent content updates.

## Active Decisions

The following decisions are actively shaping the site's development:

1. **Intentional Minimalism** - The deliberate choice to avoid frameworks and maintain a "bare-bones" technical approach.
2. **Mobile-First Design** - Continued commitment to responsive design principles, with mobile experiences prioritized.
3. **Case Study Selection** - Curating specific projects that best demonstrate skills and experience:
   - AfterPromCentral Events Calendar (WordPress plugin development)
   - Integrate Design System Audit (design language development)
   - Two additional case studies in progress

## Next Steps

Based on the current state of the site, potential next steps include:

1. **Complete In-Progress Case Studies**:
   - Integrate Asset Library Redesign
   - Integrate ABM Web Analytics
   
   Both are present in the code but commented out and marked "Under Construction"

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Further image optimization
   - Potential JavaScript refinements

3. **Content Updates**:
   - Ensure all professional information remains current
   - Potentially add new case studies as they become available

4. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Consider progressive enhancement opportunities
   - Evaluate potential for minimal build process

## Integration Points

The site has several key integration points that require attention during updates:

1. **Header/Footer Components** - Shared across all pages via the layout.js loading mechanism
2. **CSS Variables** - Color system defined in root variables
3. **Responsive Image Sets** - Coordinated image size variants across breakpoints
4. **Navigation Structure** - Consistent navigation patterns

## Current Technical Focus

The current technical implementation emphasizes:

1. **Component Reusability** - Despite not using a framework, the site follows component principles
2. **Responsive Design** - Careful attention to mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences
3. **Progressive Image Loading** - Using lazy loading for performance
4. **Accessibility Considerations** - Including proper alt text and screen reader accommodations

## Outstanding Questions

Areas that may need clarification or decisions:

1. **Analytics Integration** - The site has commented-out Google Analytics code, suggesting this may be planned but not implemented
2. **Additional Portfolio Expansion** - Whether additional case studies beyond the four current ones (two active, two pending) are planned
3. **Technical Modernization** - Whether to maintain the current jQuery approach or consider more modern alternatives
