# Active Context - Gabe Velez Portfolio Website

## Current Focus

The Gabe Velez portfolio website is currently in a functional state with core features implemented. The current focus has expanded for portfolio launch preparation:

1. **Completing Additional Case Studies** - Two case studies are currently active, with two more to be written:
   - Integrate Asset Library Redesign (in progress)
   - Integrate ABM Web Analytics (planned)
2. **Contact Form Implementation** - Adding a professional contact form for client/employer inquiries
3. **Analytics & Privacy Implementation** - Adding Google Analytics/Tag Manager followed by cookie consent system
4. **Resume Updates** - The site includes a 2025 version of the resume (GabeVelezResume2025.pdf)
5. **Final Portfolio Launch Preparation** - Ensuring all elements are ready for professional launch

## Recent Changes

Based on code analysis, recent changes include:

1. **Case Study Implementation** - The AfterPromCentral Events Calendar case study was recently completed (dated January-March 2024).
2. **jQuery Update** - The site uses jQuery 3.7.1, which is a recent version, suggesting an update to the library.
3. **Resume Update** - The presence of a 2025-dated resume indicates recent content updates.
4. **Dynamic Background Implementation** - Added dynamic-background.js to create smooth color transitions in case studies based on scroll position.
5. **Style Enhancements** - Implemented NYCNY Categories Demo Component with swipeable mobile interface.
6. **Case Study Structure Improvement** - Added standard summary sections to case studies to provide concise overviews of key points before detailed content.

## Active Decisions

The following decisions are actively shaping the site's development:

1. **Intentional Minimalism** - The deliberate choice to avoid frameworks and maintain a "bare-bones" technical approach.
2. **Mobile-First Design** - Continued commitment to responsive design principles, with mobile experiences prioritized.
3. **Case Study Selection** - Curating specific projects that best demonstrate skills and experience:
   - AfterPromCentral Events Calendar (WordPress plugin development)
   - Integrate Design System Audit (design language development)
   - NYCNewYears.com Site Overhaul (site optimization and UX improvements)
   - One additional case study in progress
4. **Enhanced Visual Experience** - Decision to implement dynamic background color transitions to create a more engaging and cohesive case study reading experience.
5. **Standardized Case Study Format** - Implementation of a consistent summary section format across case studies to improve readability and information retention.

## Next Steps

Based on the expanded scope for portfolio launch preparation:

1. **Complete Case Studies** (Priority 1):
   - Write Integrate Asset Library Redesign case study
   - Write Integrate ABM Web Analytics case study
   - Update homepage to display all four case studies

2. **Contact Form Implementation** (Priority 2):
   - Design contact form that matches site aesthetic
   - Implement form processing (likely using Netlify Forms or similar GitHub Pages-compatible solution)
   - Add form validation and user feedback
   - Integrate with existing component loading system

3. **Analytics Implementation** (Priority 3):
   - Set up Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager
   - Implement tracking across all pages
   - Configure goal tracking for contact form submissions

4. **Cookie Consent System** (Priority 4):
   - Implement custom cookie consent solution (plan already documented)
   - Create privacy policy page
   - Test consent flow and analytics integration

5. **Final Launch Preparation** (Priority 5):
   - Complete final testing across all devices
   - Verify all links and functionality
   - Performance optimization review
   - SEO and metadata verification

## Integration Points

The site has several key integration points that require attention during updates:

1. **Header/Footer Components** - Shared across all pages via the layout.js loading mechanism
2. **CSS Variables** - Color system defined in root variables
3. **Responsive Image Sets** - Coordinated image size variants across breakpoints
4. **Navigation Structure** - Consistent navigation patterns

## Current Technical Focus

The current technical implementation emphasizes:

1. **Component Reusability** - Despite not using a framework, the site follows component principles
2. **Responsive Design** - Careful attention to mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences
3. **Progressive Image Loading** - Using lazy loading for performance
4. **Accessibility Considerations** - Including proper alt text and screen reader accommodations

## Outstanding Questions

Areas that may need clarification or decisions:

1. **Analytics Integration** - The site has commented-out Google Analytics code, suggesting this may be planned but not implemented
2. **Additional Portfolio Expansion** - Whether additional case studies beyond the four current ones (two active, two pending) are planned
3. **Technical Modernization** - Whether to maintain the current jQuery approach or consider more modern alternatives
