# LinkedIn Profile Update Guide

## Overview

This guide provides specific recommendations for optimizing your LinkedIn profile to showcase your analytics dashboard expertise, Fortune 500 experience, and full-stack capabilities. Each section aligns with your resume positioning as a product designer-engineer who works at scale.

---

## 1. Professional Headline

**Current Best Practice**: Clear value proposition showing experience level, specialty, scale, and differentiator (max 220 characters)

**Recommended Headline Options:**

**Option A (Impact + Scale - RECOMMENDED):**
```
Product Designer-Engineer | Analytics Dashboards for Fortune 500 | Scaled Platforms to 200K+ Users | React + Figma
```

**Option B (Skills-focused):**
```
Senior Product Designer | B2B Analytics Dashboards • Data Visualization • Full-Stack | Microsoft, Cloudflare Clients
```

**Option C (Growth-focused):**
```
Product Designer + Engineer | 60% Conversion Growth • 200K+ Users • Analytics Dashboards • React/Next.js • B2B SaaS
```

**Recommendation**: Use Option A - it immediately shows your analytics dashboard expertise, Fortune 500experience, scale (200K+ users), and technical skills. This positions you above generic "product designer" profiles.

**Why these work:**
- Lead with your most valuable skill (analytics dashboards)
- Show enterprise credibility (Fortune 500)
- Demonstrate scale (200K+ users)
- Include technical capabilities (React)
- Avoid generic buzzwords

## 2. About Section

**Best Practice**: 2000-2600 character story covering your expertise, key work, how you work, and what you're looking for

**Recommended About Section:**

```
I'm a product designer and engineer with 10+ years designing analytics dashboards, data visualization tools, and products that scale. I've designed B2B platforms for Fortune 500 clients and scaled consumer products to 200K+ users.

WHAT I DO

I specialize in:
• Analytics dashboards and data visualization (engagement scoring, conversion funnels, behavior analytics)
• B2B SaaS products that serve enterprise teams
• Full-stack product development (React, Next.js, Firebase)
• 0-1 product ownership from concept through launch
• Conversion optimization with measurable results (60% YoY improvement)

I combine design expertise with engineering skills—I don't just design interfaces, I build them. This lets me ship faster, collaborate better with engineering teams, and understand technical constraints from day one.

KEY WORK

ListenLoop (acquired by Integrate) | Principal Product Designer
• Sole designer for Account-Based Marketing platform serving B2B sales teams at Microsoft, Cloudflare, and other enterprise clients
• Designed analytics dashboards transforming visitor data into actionable account insights
• Built web personalization module for dynamic content based on real-time visitor signals
• Created multi-account management interface for agencies monitoring 10-50+ client accounts

A&N Online Marketing | Senior Product Designer & Engineering Lead

TokTix | Founder & Development Engineer (Current)

• Designed product experience end-to-end and handled iOS/Android deployment

HOW I WORK

I thrive in cross-functional teams where design, product, and engineering work together from day one. I use data to inform decisions, ship iteratively, and measure outcomes.

I'm comfortable in ambiguity. Give me a complex problem, access to users, and a collaborative team—I'll ship a solution that works.

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

I'm seeking my next challenge with a team that:
• Values design as strategic, not just visual
• Ships fast and measures impact
• Works cross-functionally without silos
• Solves real problems for real users

If you're building products that need someone who can design, code, and drive results, let's connect.

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm currently updating my LinkedIn profile as I explore new opportunities, and I'd be honored if you'd be willing to write a brief recommendation.

We worked together on [specific project - e.g., "the ListenLoop analytics dashboard" or "the A&N conversion optimization project"], and I really valued [specific thing - e.g., "your partnership on the data visualization approach" or "our collaboration between design and engineering"].

If you're comfortable writing a recommendation, it would be great if you could touch on:
• [Specific skill - e.g., "my ability to translate complex data into clear visualizations"]
• [Specific outcome - e.g., "the dashboard work we did for enterprise clients"]
• [Any specific impact - e.g., "how the designs improved team velocity"]

I know you're busy, so no pressure at all—and I'd be happy to return the favor with a recommendation for you as well.

Thanks for considering!

Best,
Gabe
