```
I'm a product designer and engineer who builds analytics dashboards and products that scale. 10+ years designing for platforms that serve Fortune 500 teams and scaling consumer platforms to 200K+ users.

WHAT I BUILD

I specialize in:
• Analytics dashboards for B2B sales platforms (engagement scoring, conversion funnels, behavior analytics)
• Data visualization that turns complex data into actionable insights
• Full-stack product development (React, Next.js, React Native, Firebase)
• 0-1 products from concept through iOS/Android deployment
• Conversion-optimized experiences (60% YoY improvement)

I don't just design interfaces—I build them. This lets me ship faster, understand technical constraints from day one, and collaborate better with engineering teams.

KEY WORK

ListenLoop (acquired by Integrate) | Principal Product Designer
• Sole designer for Account-Based Marketing platform serving B2B sales teams at Microsoft, Cloudflare, and enterprise clients
• Designed analytics dashboard transforming visitor tracking into actionable account insights: engagement scoring, behavior analytics, conversion funnels, multi-touch attribution

HOW I WORK

I thrive in teams where design, product, and engineering collaborate from day one. I use data to make decisions, ship iteratively, and measure outcomes.

Give me a complex problem, access to users, and a collaborative team—I'll ship a solution that works.

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

Teams that:
• Value design as strategic, not just visual
• Ship fast and measure impact
• Work cross-functionally without silos
• Solve real problems for real users

If you're building products that need someone who can design, code, and drive results, let's talk.

I know you're busy, so no pressure at all—and I'd be happy to return the favor with a recommendation for you as well.

Thanks for considering!

Best,
