# About Me Page

## Description
Created an enticing About Me page with professional information, accomplishments, and personality traits.

## Content Sources
From LinkedIn:
"I've been fascinated with design for as long as I can remember. I'm a designer with over 15 years of freelance experience creating lasting brand strategies through my company, Design On Cue.

What once started in print design has hugely evolved towards creating logo & brand initiatives as well as User Experience Design for different web and mobile startups. In my spare time I have had the pleasure of co-founding a few small startups, too!

I have numerous awards under my belt, including the Winner of the 2014 Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator Hackathon, working with the Gamechaser team to design for Gamechat, their cross-platform chat application. I also won the 2013 Summer Startup Weekend in NYC as co-founder of Linesnapp, a community-based app that allows you to outsmart lines together. I also was won at the 2013 Visa Global Security Summit for Voutche, a mobile app dedicated to securing your social media."
