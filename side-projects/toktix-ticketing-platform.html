                    <h3 class="block__title">Context</h3>
                    <p>TokTix represents a complete end-to-end product development challenge: building a modern ticketing platform from concept to beta-ready deployment. As a solo developer, I took on the full scope of product development including market research, UX design, mobile app development, web platform creation, backend architecture, and deployment infrastructure.</p>

                    <p>The project targets the nightlife event management market, where existing platforms like Posh, Luma, and Dice have adopted feature-heavy approaches that often overwhelm users. My goal was to prove that a single developer could architect and build a competitive platform by focusing on strategic simplicity and technical excellence.</p>

                    <p>The technical scope includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>React Native mobile application with offline capabilities</li>
                        <li>Cross-domain web platform with Next.js</li>
                        <li>Firebase backend with real-time features</li>
                        <li>Stripe integration for payments</li>
                        <li>Multi-tier ticketing system</li>
                        <li>QR code scanning and verification</li>
                        <li>Image optimization and processing</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="block block__red">
                <div class="block__container">
                    <h3 class="block__title">The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>Building a production-ready ticketing platform as a solo developer presents unique challenges that stretch across multiple domains of expertise:</p>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">Technical Architecture Complexity</h4>
                    <p>The platform requires seamless integration between mobile and web experiences, real-time data synchronization, secure payment processing, and offline functionality for ticket scanning. Managing this complexity while maintaining code quality and security standards demands careful architectural planning and execution.</p>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">UX Design Philosophy</h4>
                    <p>Competing platforms suffer from feature bloat that complicates core user flows. The challenge was designing an interface that maintains simplicity while supporting complex behind-the-scenes functionality like multi-tier ticket management, event publishing workflows, and cross-platform authentication.</p>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">Full-Stack Development Scope</h4>
                    <p>As the sole developer, I needed to master and implement:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mobile app development with React Native and Expo</li>
                        <li>Modern web development with Next.js and TypeScript</li>
                        <li>Backend architecture with Firebase and Cloud Functions</li>
                        <li>Payment processing integration with Stripe Connect</li>
                        <li>Image processing and optimization systems</li>
                        <li>Real-time database design and security rules</li>
                        <li>Cross-domain authentication and session management</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">Solo Development Workflow</h4>
                    <p>Managing the entire development lifecycle alone required establishing efficient workflows for design iteration, code organization, testing strategies, and deployment processes. This included creating comprehensive documentation, implementing proper service architecture, and maintaining code quality without a team review process.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="block block__teal">
                <div class="block__container">
                    <h3 class="block__title">Solution</h3>
                    <p>My approach centered on strategic technology choices and architectural decisions that would maximize development efficiency while building a scalable, maintainable platform.</p>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">Architecture Strategy</h4>
                    <p>I designed a dual-platform architecture that separates concerns while maintaining integration:</p>

                    <pre class="block__code">
Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
├── Event creation and management
├── Ticket scanning and verification  
├── Real-time analytics dashboard
└── Offline-capable operations

Web Platform (Next.js + TypeScript)
├── Event landing pages (events.toktix.com)
├── Checkout and payment processing
├── Marketing site (toktix.com)
└── SEO-optimized event discovery

Backend Infrastructure (Firebase)
├── Authentication and user management
├── Real-time database with Firestore
├── Cloud Functions for business logic
├── Image storage and optimization
└── Stripe Connect integration
                    </pre>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">Service Architecture Design</h4>
                    <p>To prevent the technical debt that typically accumulates in solo projects, I implemented a clean service architecture with clear separation of concerns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Event Management Service:</strong> Handles event CRUD operations and validation</li>
                        <li><strong>Publishing Service:</strong> Manages the draft-to-published workflow with error handling</li>
                        <li><strong>Image Processing Service:</strong> Optimizes and processes event images</li>
                        <li><strong>Ticket System Service:</strong> Manages multi-tier ticketing and inventory</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication Service:</strong> Handles cross-platform user sessions</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Service:</strong> Integrates Stripe Connect for promoter payouts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This modular approach prevents circular dependencies and enables independent testing and maintenance of each system component.</p>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">Cross-Domain Web Architecture</h4>
                    <p>One of the most complex challenges was implementing a cross-domain setup that provides optimal user experience while maintaining technical flexibility:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>toktix.com:</strong> Marketing site with contact forms and brand presence</li>
                        <li><strong>events.toktix.com:</strong> Event-specific landing pages and checkout system</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The architecture includes browser-specific handling for Safari to prevent redirect loops, shared authentication across domains, and optimized page generation for SEO performance.</p>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">UX Design Philosophy</h4>
                    <p>I adopted a "sleek and simple" design philosophy that prioritizes core user flows over feature abundance:</p>

                    <p><strong>For Event Promoters:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Event creation streamlined to under 2 minutes for basic setup</li>
                        <li>Draft system allows refinement before publishing</li>
                        <li>Multi-tier ticket management without complexity overhead</li>
                        <li>Real-time sales tracking with clear analytics</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>For Ticket Buyers:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Single-page event discovery with immediate purchase capability</li>
                        <li>Checkout process optimized for mobile-first experience</li>
                        <li>Clear ticket information without unnecessary steps</li>
                        <li>Instant ticket delivery with QR codes for entry</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="block__subtitle">Technical Implementation Highlights</h4>
                    <p><strong>React Native Mobile Development:</strong> Built using Expo for rapid development and deployment flexibility.
