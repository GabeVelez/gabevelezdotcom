# Targeting Visitors for Your Portfolio Site

## Map visitor intent by page

- **Home page visitors** – Provide a succinct intro and a clear call‑to‑action (CTA) such as “See My Work” or “Get in Touch”.
- **Project pages** (e.g. Toktix, case studies) – Place context‑relevant CTAs like “Schedule a Consultation” or “Download Detailed Case Study” near the end of each project story, when the visitor is most engaged.
- **Resume/Contact page visitors** – Embed a short contact form or calendar widget to book a call; visitors here are likely considering working with you.

## Capture contact details

- Add a subtle **newsletter sign‑up** bar (“Join my mailing list”) offering value—tips, insights, or early access to new projects.
- Use a **lead magnet** aligned with your work, e.g. a downloadable checklist or template used in a case study.
- Implement a **micro‑conversion** button (“Get my free design audit checklist”) to collect emails before presenting the download.

## Personalize and retarget

- In **PostHog**, create properties to identify traffic sources and build **cohorts** for visitors who viewed particular pages so you can tailor follow‑up messages.
- In **Google Analytics**, define **Audiences** based on sessions (e.g. users who spend >2 minutes on a case‑study page) and connect to Google Ads or another retargeting platform to show ads inviting them back (e.g. to book a consultation).
- For returning visitors, display a **personalized banner** (“Welcome back—see what’s new in my projects”) using a small script that checks for previous visits.

## Make CTAs visible but contextual

- Place CTAs at natural break points (after a compelling project description or at the end of a blog post) rather than only at the top or bottom.
- Use **contrasting yet on‑brand colours** for CTA buttons so they stand out without clashing.
- Ensure CTAs are **mobile‑friendly**, since some visitors may come from mobile devices.

## Measure and iterate

- Set up **custom events** in PostHog for clicking CTAs, submitting forms, or downloading files; then build funnels to see drop‑off points.
- Use **A/B tests** (PostHog’s experiments) to compare CTA wording (“Contact Me” vs. “Schedule a Free Consultation”) and placement.
- Revisit GA’s acquisition and behaviour reports regularly to see which channels or pages bring in visitors who complete these events, and focus your promotional efforts there.
